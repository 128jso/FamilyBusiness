# Family Business Demo

A demo game of the popular board game __Family Business__

## Rules
Family business is a card game in which 2-6 players can compete for Mob dominance. Players are in charge of a group of
mobsters (9) that are placed periodically on a Hit List. When certain conditions are met, a Mob War begins and each turn the
player that's at the top of the Hit List loses a mobster forever.

In this demo, there are only two cards that can be used:
* Contract (Place Opponent's mobster on the Hit List)
* Take It on the Lam (Rescue one of your own mobsters from the Hit List)

Further rules for the game can be found [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/family-business/game-rules.php).

## Considerations
The demo has been created to enable for any number of players based on the user's choice.
The demo has also been created to enable ease of access to create new cards.
